# CognitiOS
CognitiOS is an open-source human-knowledege-centered AI OS.

From a human knowledge perspective, AI may be understood as a set of mathematical algorithms for making the knowledge an AI model executable.  
In other words, this OS is meant to manage the entire AI cycle as a support of the people's or companies' knowledge in a secure and private way. We understand by Knowledge the information gathered in a data set that is used to train AI models.

CognitiOS utilizes an agent-like entity, dubbed Cognitron, which orchestrates a series of modules forming what we may refer to as a Machine Cognitive Architecture (MCA).

Cognitron works as a web application that constantly adapts by it-self providing a customized experience according to the user preferences. This classifies CognitiOS as an Internet OS that might be called from whatever built-in web browser device.

So in short, what can you do with CognitiOS? First stage of this project will cover:
- A cutomizable and responsive user interface as per the type and request of user.
- Feed CognitiOS with data sets to find an AI model (with underlying hyper-parameters) that fits the best with data provided.
- Get the model in production available through a REST API.
- Deploy a web app to interact with the AI model in production, input data and visualize predictions.
