# CognitiOS
CognitiOS is an open-source human-knowledege-centered AI OS.

From a human knowledge perspective, AI may be understood as a set of mathematical algorithms for making the knowledge an AI model executable.  
In other words, this OS is meant to manage the entire AI cycle as a support of the people's or companies' knowledge in a secure and private way.

CognitiOS utilizes an agent-like entity, dubbed Cognitron, which orchestrates a series of modules forming what we may refer to as a Machine Cognitive Architecture (MCA).

Cognitron works as a web application that constantly adapts by it-self providing a customized experience according to the user preferences. This classifies CognitiOS as an Internet OS that might be called from every built-in web browser device.
